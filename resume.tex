% --------- Research ----------------------------------------------------

\begin{category}{Open Source Projects}

\citembullet
Working in a XFT (4 developers) to implement a ray-tracer program based on existing specification in Java-SE.
The aim of the project was to write a high quality program which is easy to read and understand, 
well-structured, well-documented, portable and easily maintainable.   
The project includes writing unit tests using Junit and test automation using Ant/Maven to ensure the functionality of the program.
Profiling also used to analyze the resource consumption of program and to optimize it. 
We use Eclipse IDE for this project.
Svn was the project's version control system (nowadays we maintain the code in Git):
https://github.com/coffeMug/ray-tracer.git

\citembullet A e-commerce project (on-line PC shop) based on MVC design pattern (n-tier architecture) and 
implemented in Java-EE development platform using Netbeans.

\citembullet
Implementing the time-stamp based concurrency control protocol for a distributed client-server system written in
Erlang/OTP.

\citembullet
During the course ``from domain to requirements'' I was a member of a team working on a software engineering
project to investigate the domain of a water distribution system. Later a formal prescription of 
requirements for the system obtained and was written in RAISE specification language

\citembullet
Writing formal specification of a double deck elevator controller software in B Specification Language using
AtelierB tool (later C code produced as the final refinement step).

\citembullet Writing a compiler for a small language, uC, and generating assembly 
code for the MIPS architecture.
The project was in a sequence of steps, where each step was a separately specified 
assignment to complete a specific component of the compiler.
The generated assembly code was executed by the SPIM MIPS simulator. 
The compiler was written using Standard ML programming language:

% -------- Work experience --------------------------------------------

\begin{category}{Work \\experiences}

\citem{Software Developer}, Ericsson , Stockholm, Sweden (November 2012 - Now)\\ \\
Working for SBG (Session Border Gateway) node in CBA migration project which is a project 
aimed for transferring the existing legacy code base (implemented in Erlang/OTP) into the 
new architecture (Component Based Architecture deployed on top of Ericsson's cloud infrastructure). 
Our development strategy is based on TDD and XP. We also develop and extend unit tests using Eunit framework, 
function tests to examine the different functionality of the SGC (Session Gateway Controller) application 
based on Erlang common test framework and we also have system tests to test the overall system in a real 
world environment (heavy load, live traffic etc.). 
We use Jenkins as our CI (Continuous Integration) tool in order to improve our software 
quality and reduce release and delivery time. I am member of an Agile team and our team-work is 
organized based on Scrum-ban method.
