% --------- Research ----------------------------------------------------

\begin{category}{Open Source Projects}

\citembullet
Work in an agile team (4 developers) to implement a ray-tracer program based on 
a mathematical written specification in Java-SE.
The aim of the project is to learn about how to write high quality large scale software 
which has clean and readable code, is well-structured, well-documented, portable and 
easily maintainable. The project work is based on TDD design principle 
which is about writing unit tests using JUnit to ensure the functionality of 
software units and to have regression testing in place. Build and tests are automated 
using Apache Maven. 
Git repository of the project is available at:
https://github.com/CoffeMug/ray-tracer.git

\citembullet A e-commerce project (on-line PC shop) based on MVC design 
pattern (n-tier architecture) and implemented in Java-EE development platform 
using Netbeans IDE:\\
https://github.com/CoffeMug/mypcshop.git

\citembullet
Implementing the time-stamp based concurrency control protocol for a 
distributed client-server system written in Erlang/OTP.

\citembullet
During the course ``from domain to requirements'' I was a member of a team 
working on a software engineering project to investigate the domain of a 
water distribution system. 
Later a formal prescription of requirements for the system obtained 
and was written in RAISE specification language

\citembullet
A chat server application written in Erlang/OTP based on OTP design principles:\\
https://github.com/CoffeMug/erlang-chat-server.git


\citembullet Writing a compiler for a small language, uC, and generating assembly 
code for the MIPS architecture.
The project was in a sequence of steps, where each step was a separately specified 
assignment to complete a specific component of the compiler.
The generated assembly code was executed by the SPIM MIPS simulator. 
The compiler was written using Standard ML programming language:

% -------- Work experience --------------------------------------------

\begin{category}{Work \\experiences}

\citem{Software Developer}, Ericsson , Stockholm, Sweden (November 2012 - Now)\\ \\
Working for SBG (Session Border Gateway) node in CBA migration project which is a project 
aimed for transferring the existing legacy code base (implemented in Erlang/OTP) into the 
new architecture (Component Based Architecture deployed on top of Ericsson's cloud infrastructure). 
We work based on TDD and pair programming techniques to improve code quality and
speed up team's assignments. We use Erlang Eunit framework for the TDD code development and also
for regression testing of legacy code.
To test on feature level and to examine the different aspects of the SGC (Session Gateway Controller) 
application we develop tests based on Erlang common test framework. We 
also have system tests to test the overall functionality of the live system in a (heavy load, live traffic etc.). 
We use Jenkins as our CI (Continuous Integration) tool in order to build and run automated tests and  
reduce release and delivery time.
