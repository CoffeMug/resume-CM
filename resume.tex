\begin{category}{Work \\experience}

\citem{Senior Software Designer}, Infinera corporation, Stockholm, Sweden (November 2015 - Now)\\
Work in an agile (Scrum) team responsible for development and maintenance of security
and installation/upgrade blocks. Those are part of a large scale code base running on 
the control unit (\texttt{Linux} platform) of Infinera packet optical networking solutions.
\begin{itemize}
 \item Develop, design and implement the software specification; mainly in \texttt{C} and partly in \texttt{C++}.
 \item Refactor the code base following clean code principles to facilitate maintainability and testability of the code.
 \item Design functional tests specification to be used for implementing automated function test written in \texttt{Python}.
 \item Contribute to the design and improvement of the GUI part of the code as well (\texttt{Javascript} and \texttt{JQuery}).
 \item Participate in the regression testing of the implemented feature with respect to the whole software stability and performance. 
\end{itemize}

\citem{R\&D Software Developer/test engineer}, Ericsson, Stockholm, Sweden (November 2012 - October 2015)\\
Working in a cross functional team for SBG product in CBA migration project to 
transfer and extend the existing product code base into the new architecture and also 
adding new features and functionality to the system to support the customer's requirements.
Using TDD and pair programming techniques and Agile way of work to improve code quality and
speed up team's assignments. Applying Continuous Integration practices via automated build and tests to 
make sure the high quality software will be delivered to the market and on time.
\begin{itemize}
 \item Design and implement features for the SBG software system from scratch using 
       Erlang and OTP design patterns.
 \item Implement unit tests for the new modules and functions of the system as well as 
       writing the integration test to test modules combined and grouped together. 
 \item Extending and improving existing features of the system to facilitate the 
       migration into the new architecture.
 \item Design and implement feature test suites to test different features of the 
       system such as robustness, software management, logging, network, registration 
       etc. using Erlang common test framework.
 \item Automate the build and test process of the whole product in order to reduce the production time
       while securing delivery of the high quality software.
 \item Using container technologies (\texttt{LXC}) and Kernel Based Virtualization to utilize the 
       test hardware in a more efficient and cost saving way.
\end{itemize}

\citem{Research Assistant}, Mobility Research Group, Department of Information Technology, 
Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden (July 2012 - October 2012)\\
Continue to work on my thesis and extend the features of the type checker which I 
implement during my master thesis work.
\begin{itemize}
 \item Study the theory of type systems and mobile processes with a 
       focus on the typed Psi-calculi theory and its implementation details.
 \item Implement and extend the type system for different instances of Psi-calculi 
       using the Standard ML programming language.
\end{itemize}

\citem{Full-Stack Web Developer (part-time)}, SCWMRI, Tehran, Iran (June 2008 â€“ August 2009)
Design and development of a content management system for the SCWMRI research institute. 
The system is implemented based on the MVC design pattern and using Microsoft visual web developer. 
Microsoft SQL Server is used as the DBMS to support data management. 

\citem{Software Developer}, Tehran Water Company, Tehran, Iran (May 2005 - August 2009)\\
Working as a software developer for the Tehran Water Telemetry project. The aim of the 
project is to implement the telemetry and telecommand software system for the company.
\begin{itemize}
 \item Design, develop and maintain the telemetry software system on the main control center using 
       \texttt{C++} (real time core parts) and on the analyzing and visualization part in \texttt{Java}.
 \item Design, develop and maintain the software system on the remote control stations using \texttt{C\#})
       on Microsoft Windows Server platform.
 \item Design and implement the database system of the telemetry software 
       using Oracle database management system.
 \item Write unit test using \texttt{NUnit}, \texttt{JUnit} and function test 
       suites to execute load, performance and stress tests (using \texttt{Apache JMeter}) 
       to make sure the highest quality of software system.
\end{itemize}
