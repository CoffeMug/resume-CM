% -------- Work experience --------------------------------------------
\begin{category}{Work \\experience}

\citem{Software Developer}, Ericsson , Stockholm, Sweden (November 2012 - Now)\\ \\
Working for SBG (Session Border Gateway) node in CBA migration project which is a project 
aimed for transferring the existing legacy code base (implemented in Erlang/OTP) into the 
new architecture (Component Based Architecture deployed on top of Ericsson's cloud infrastructure). 
We work based on TDD and pair programming techniques to improve code quality and
speed up team's assignments. We use Erlang Eunit framework for the TDD code development and also
for regression testing of legacy code.
To test on feature level and to examine the different aspects of the SGC (Session Gateway Controller) 
application we develop tests based on Erlang common test framework. We 
also have system tests to test the overall functionality of the live system in a (heavy load, live traffic etc.). 
We use Jenkins as our CI (Continuous Integration) tool in order to build and run automated tests and  
reduce release and delivery time.
