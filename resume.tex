\begin{category}{Work \\experience}

\citem{R\&D Software Developer/test engineer}, Ericsson, Stockholm, Sweden (November 2012 - Now)\\
Working in a cross functional team for SBG product in CBA migration project to 
transfer and extend the existing product code base into the new architecture and also 
adding new features and functionality to the system to support the customer's requirements.
Using TDD and pair programming techniques and Agile way of work to improve code quality and
speed up team's assignments. Applying Continuous Integration practices via automated build and tests to 
make sure the high quality software will be delivered to the market and on time.
\begin{itemize}
 \item Design and implement features for the SBG software system from scratch using 
       Erlang and OTP design patterns.
 \item Implement unit tests for the new modules and functions of the system as well as 
       writing the integration test to test modules combined and grouped together. 
 \item Extending and improving existing features of the system to facilitate the 
       migration into the new architecture.
 \item Design and implement feature test suites to test different features of the 
       system such as robustness, software management, logging, network, registration 
       etc. using Erlang common test framework.
 \item Automate the build and test process of the whole product in order to reduce the production time
       while securing delivery of the high quality software.
 \item Make use of container technologies (\texttt{LXC}) and Kernel Based Virtualization in order to utilize the 
       available test hardware in a much more efficient and cost saving way.
\end{itemize}

\citem{Research Assistant}, Mobility Research Group, Department of Information Technology, 
Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden (July 2012 - October 2012)\\
Continue to work on my thesis and extend the features of the type checker which I 
implement during my master thesis work.
\begin{itemize}
 \item Study the theory of type systems and mobile processes with a 
       focus on the typed Psi-calculi theory and its implementation details.
 \item Implement and extend the type system for different instances of Psi-calculi 
       using the Standard ML programming language.
\end{itemize}

\citem{Software Developer}, Tehran Water Company, Tehran, Iran (May 2005 - August 2009)\\
Working as a software developer for the Tehran Water Telemetry project. The aim of the 
project is to implement the telemetry and telecommand software system for the company.
\begin{itemize}
 \item Design, develop and maintain the telemetry software system on the main control center using 
       \texttt{C++} (real time core parts) and on the analyzing and visualization part in \texttt{Java}.
 \item Design, develop and maintain the software system on the remote control stations using \texttt{C\#})
       on Microsoft Windows Server platform.
 \item Design and implement the database system of the telemetry software 
       using Oracle database management system.
 \item Write unit test using \texttt{NUnit}, \texttt{JUnit} and function test 
       suites to execute load, performance and stress tests (using \texttt{Apache JMeter}) 
       to make sure the highest quality of software system. 
\end{itemize}

\citem{Front-end and Back-end Developer (part-time)}, SCWMRI Research Institute, 
Tehran, Iran (April 2007 - September 2008)
\begin{itemize} 
\item Design and develop a CMS (content management system) to represent as a 
      digital portal for the institute using \texttt{ASP.NET MVC}.
\item Design the database management system for data manipulation of the CMS using \texttt{MS-SQL}.
\end{itemize}
